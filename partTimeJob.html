							<h1 class="major">Part-time Job</h1>
							<p>In addition to my academic pursuits and independent learning endeavors, I have been dedicated to gaining valuable real-world experience through part-time employment. 
                                On weekends, I work as a <strong>Line Cook</strong> at <strong><a href="https://localpubliceatery.com/neighbourhoods/liberty-village/" alt="" target="_blank">Local Public Eatery</a></strong>, a renowned establishment in Liberty Village known for its exceptional culinary offerings and vibrant atmosphere. 
                                This role not only assists in covering my daily expenses but also aligns with my passion for cooking. 
                                I find immense joy in crafting dishes that delight our patrons, and receiving positive feedback about my food is truly rewarding. 
                                My primary mission at Local Public Eatery is to ensure that <strong>each dish is prepared to the highest standards, following precise recipes and food presentation specifications </strong> set by the management. 
                                In a <strong>fast-paced restaurant environment</strong>, I <strong>collaborate seamlessly with my team</strong> to deliver outstanding meals to our customers. 
                                I am experienced in <strong>handling large orders under high pressure and time constraints</strong>, which has honed my ability to thrive in demanding situations. 
                                My dedication to excellence and <strong>strong work ethic</strong> were quickly recognized, leading to a <strong>promotion from Dishwasher to Line Cook</strong> within just two months after joining the team. 
                                Although I was offered the role of a shift leader, I opted to focus on my academic and career aspirations in technology, as my passion lies in software development and computer science rather than a long-term career in the culinary field.</p>
