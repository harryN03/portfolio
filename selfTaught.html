							<p>I am deeply committed to continually enhancing my skills and expanding my knowledge independently. 
                                In addition to the courses offered by my university, I actively seek out supplementary online resources to stay at the forefront of my field. 
                                Platforms like <strong>Coursera</strong> and <strong>YouTube</strong> have been invaluable in this journey, providing me with access to a wealth of high-quality educational content.
                                Notably, I have completed a comprehensive program on Coursera, earning the <strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer" alt="" target="_blank">'IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional'</a></strong> certification. 
                                This program includes a series of <strong>12 courses</strong>, each focusing on different aspects of software development. 
                                Through these courses, I gained proficiency in a wide range of areas, including <strong>cloud computing, back-end development, front-end development, database management, and effective use of tools like GitHub</strong>. 
                                These self-paced courses not only allowed me to explore nice topics of interest but also provided practical, hands-on experience that complements my university education.
                                I've also delved into advanced web development through YouTube tutorials, learning some new libraries like <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to create <strong>dynamic and responsive</strong> web applications.
                            </p>

                            <p>And here are some courses and projects I want to take in the next few weeks/months:</p>
