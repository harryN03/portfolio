							<h1 class="major">Full-time student</h1>
							<p>I am currently in my third year as a dedicated <strong>Computer Science major</strong> and <strong>Economics Minor</strong>.</p>
							<p>During the first two years of my academic journey, I had the opportunity to delve into a wide range of subjects, which has enriched my knowledge and skills significantly. 
                                I've explored a multitude of programming languages, including <strong>Python, Java, Rust, C,</strong>, and more honing my ability to craft efficient and elegant code. 
                                Additionally, I've delved into the intricacies of <strong>algorithm</strong> design and <strong>data structures</strong>, enabling me to approach complex problem-solving with confidence. 
                                Beyond programming, I've delved into the realm of <strong>operating systems</strong>, particularly <strong>Linux</strong>, gaining insights into the core of computing systems. 
                                Furthermore, <strong>mathematics</strong> has played a vital role in shaping my analytical thinking and problem-solving capabilities. 
                                This comprehensive foundation equips me with a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of the fundamental principles of computer science.</p>
                            <p>In my current semester, I am actively pursuing a diverse set of courses that broaden my understanding of computer technology across multiple domains.
                                I am taking <strong>Web Development</strong> course, where I have chance to improve my skills in both front-end technologies like <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> and back-end programming languages such as <strong>JavaScript, PHP, and Perl</strong>.
                                Additionally, I am delving into the exciting realms of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, utilizing <strong>Python</strong> to explore the potential of these transformative fields. And these courses really raise my <strong>interest</strong> in these field.
                                My coursework also encompasses <strong>Database Systems</strong>, where I am gaining valuable insights into <strong>managing and optimizing data</strong>. 
                                Furthermore, I am dedicated to understanding the critical aspect of <strong>Computer Security</strong>, as safeguarding digital assets becomes increasingly important in today's interconnected world.
